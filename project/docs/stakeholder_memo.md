**Subject:** Proposal: A Data-Driven Recommendation System to Increase Sales and Customer Loyalty

## 1. Problem
We've observed that new customers often struggle to choose from the menu, while our loyal customers tend to order the same items. This presents a missed opportunity to enhance their experience and increase sales.

## 2. Proposed Solution
We propose developing a simple, data-driven recommendation system using our existing sales data. The system will have two key features:
* **For New Guests:** It will automatically identify and suggest our "Top 10 Bestsellers" and "Perfect Pairings" (e.g., our most popular coffee and pastry combo).
* **For Returning Guests:** It will use their order history to provide personalized suggestions like, "Because you enjoyed our latte, you might love our new caramel macchiato."

## 3. Expected Benefits
* **Increased Sales:** Guide new customers toward high-margin, popular items and encourage all customers to try new things.
* **Improved Customer Loyalty:** A personalized experience makes customers feel valued and more likely to return.
* **Data-Driven Decisions:** Provide clear data on which items to feature in weekly specials or promotional campaigns.

We are confident that this project will provide a significant return by turning data into a better customer experience and a healthier bottom line.
