# Project Title: Recommendation Engine for Customer Retention

**Stage:** Problem Framing & Scoping (Stage 01) 

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to address the core challenges of new customer guidance and existing customer retention for businesses in the service (mainly food service) industry. New customers often feel overwhelmed by unfamiliar menus, while returning customers may miss new items they would enjoy. Both scenarios lead to potential lost sales and decreased customer satisfaction. Businesses generally lack a data-driven tool to optimize the customer's ordering experience to increase sales and loyalty. 

## Stakeholder & User
The primary decision-maker is the restaurant/cafe owner or manager. They will use the insights to decide on weekly specials, promotional combos, and targeted marketing efforts. The end-users are the customers (both new and returning) who receive the recommendations to enhance their dining experience.

## Useful Answer & Decision
A useful answer is a hybrid system:

**Descriptive:** For new customers, a ranked list of "Most Popular Items" or "Frequently Paired Items".

**Predictive:** For returning customers, a list of personalized recommendations based on their order history from other places.

The final artifact will be code containing the analysis and model prototype, accompanied by a summary report. This will help the owner decide which items to promote to drive sales.

## Assumptions & Constraints
**Assumption:** 
* Historical transaction data, including customer IDs (or a proxy like a loyalty card number) and items purchased, is available and accessible.
* Item popularity is a reasonably good indicator of quality and a safe recommendation for new customers.

**Constraint:** 
* This project will deliver a proof-of-concept prototype, not a real-time, production-ready application.
* The analysis will be based on past data and may not account for sudden changes in customer taste or seasonal trends. 

## Known Unknowns / Risks
**Risk:** 
* The quality of the transaction data may be poor (inconsistent item names, missing entries), requiring significant time for cleaning.
* The dataset may not be large enough to generate statistically significant personalized recommendations.

**Mitigation:** 
* We will perform thorough Exploratory Data Analysis to assess data quality and sparsity. If personalization is not feasible, the project will focus on robust descriptive recommendations for all users, try to find a more "neutral" sulution. 

## Lifecycle Mapping
| Goal | Stage & Deliverable |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Define the project scope, stakeholders, and success criteria.** | **Stage 01: Problem Framing & Scoping** <br>  Deliverable: A detailed `README.md` file and a Stakeholder Memo. |
| **Collect, clean, and understand the transaction data; identify patterns and limitations.** | **Stage 02: Data Exploration & Preparation** <br>  Deliverable: An Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Jupyter Notebook with key visualizations (something like, item popularity charts, sales trends) and a data quality assessment. |
| **Develop recommendation logic for both new and returning customers.** | **Stage 03: Modeling & Analysis** <br>  Deliverable: A modeling Jupyter Notebook containing code for both: (1) The descriptive model for new customers (for example, top-N popular items) and (2) The predictive model for returning customers (like collaborative filtering). |
| **Assess the model's effectiveness and the business relevance of the recommendations.** | **Stage 04: Evaluation** <br>  Deliverable: An evaluation section within the modeling notebook, including offline metrics for the predictive model and a qualitative analysis of the recommendations. |
| **Collect all findings into a clear, actionable report for the stakeholder.** | **Stage 05: Reporting & Delivery** <br>  Deliverable: A final summary report for the business owner, explaining the findings and business suggestions in non-technical terms. A clean, well-commented final version of the project notebook. |
## Repo Plan
* **/data/:** Raw and processed datasets.
* **/notebooks/:** Jupyter Notebooks(.ipynb) for analysis, modeling, and exploration.
* **/src/:** Reusable Python functions and classes.
* **/docs/:** Project documentation, including the stakeholder memo and final report.
* **Cadence:** The repo will be updated at the end of each major stage of the project lifecycle.
