# Stage 12 Deliverable: Final Report

## Audience and Rationale

* **Chosen Audience**: Investment Committee
* **Rationale**: The chosen audience consists of decision-makers who need clear, concise, and actionable insights. They are familiar with financial concepts like return and volatility but may not be experts in data science methodology.

## Format and Rationale

* **Chosen Format**: Written Report (PDF generated from Jupyter Notebook)
* **Rationale**: A written report is ideal for this audience because it provides a self-contained, structured narrative. It allows them to review the findings, visualizations, and underlying assumptions at their own pace. Exporting from a notebook also ensures full reproducibility, as the code, charts, and analysis are presented together, which builds trust and transparency.
